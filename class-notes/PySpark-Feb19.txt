  Spark
  -----

     => Spark is in-memory distributed computing framework for big data analytics.	

	in-memory: ability to persist intermediate results and subsequent operations
		   can directly work on these persisted intermediate results. 

     => Spark is written in Scala programming language
 
     => Spark is polyglot
	-> Support Scala, Java, Python, R

     => Spark can run on multiple cluster managers
	local, spark standalone scheduler, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes

     => Spark is unified analytics framework


  Spark Unified Framework
  -----------------------

	Spark provides a consistent set of APIs for performing different analytics workloads
        using the same execution engine and some well defined data abstractions and operations.

   	Batch Analytics of unstructured data	-> Spark Core API (low-level api)
	Batch Analytics of structured data 	-> Spark SQL
	Streaming Analytics (real time)		-> Spark Streaming, Structured Streaming
	Predictive analytics (ML)		-> Spark MLLib
	Graph parallel computations  		-> Spark GraphX


   Getting started with Spark

   Spark Architecture
   ------------------

	1. Cluster Manager (CM)
		-> Applications are submitted to CMs
		-> Allocates containers for lauching driver and executors on the cluster. 
		-> Spark supports multiple CMs
			-> local, standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes		

	2. Driver
		-> Master process
		-> Runs the 'SparkContext' object
		-> Manages the user code and sends the tasks to the executors as per the code. 

		Deploy Modes:
		-> Where to run the driver process
		1. Client : default, driver runs on the client. 
		2. Cluster: driver runs on one of the nodes on the cluster.

	3. SparkContext
		-> Is an application context
		-> Starting point of execution
		-> Is the link between the driver and tasks running on the executors

	4. Executors
		-> receives the tasks from the Driver
		-> all tasks run the same execution code but on different partitions of the data
		-> the status of tasks are reported to the driver. 



   RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)
   -----------------------------------

	-> RDD is the fundamental data abstraction of Spark

	-> RDD is a collection of distributed in-memory partitions.
	    -> Each partition is a collection of objects of some type.

	-> RDDs are immutable

	-> RDDs are lazily evaluated
	   -> Transformations does not cause execution.
	   -> Action commands trigger execution.


  Creating RDDs
  -------------

	Three ways:

	1. Creating an RDD from some external dataset
		rddFile = sc.textFile("E:\\Spark\\wordcount.txt", 4)

	2. Create an RDD from some pragrammatic data
		rdd1 = sc.parallelize([4,3,2,1,2,3,2,3,5,4,6,5,7,6,8,9,0,9,8,7,8,6,1,3,2,1,3,2], 3)

	3. By applying transformations on existing RDDs
		rddWords = rddFile.flatMap(lambda x: x.split())


  RDD Operations
  --------------
    Two types of operations

	1. Transformations
		-> Transformations return RDDs
		-> Transformations does not cause execution of RDDs
		-> Cause lineage DAGs to be created

	2. Actions
		-> Triggers execution of RDDs
		-> Produces output by sending a Job to the cluster


  RDD Lineage DAG
  ---------------
  Driver maintains a Lineage DAG for every RDD
  Lineage DAG is a heirarchy of dependencies of RDDs all the way starting from the very first RDD	
  Lineage DAG is a logical plan on how to compute the partitions of the RDD.


	rddFile = sc.textFile("E:\\Spark\\wordcount.txt", 4)
		Lineage of rddFile -> (4) rddFile -> sc.textFile on "E:\\Spark\\wordcount.txt"

	rddWords = rddFile.flatMap(lambda x: x.split())
		Lineage of rddWords -> (4) rddWords -> rddFile.flatMap -> sc.textFile on "E:\\Spark\\wordcount.txt"
	
	rddPairs = rddWords.map(lambda x: (x, 1))
		Lineage of rddWords -> (4) rddPairs -> rddWords.map -> rddFile.flatMap -> sc.textFile

	rddWc = rddPairs.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y)
		Lineage of rddWords -> (4) rddWc -> rddPairs.reduceByKey -> rddWords.map -> rddFile.flatMap -> sc.textFile
