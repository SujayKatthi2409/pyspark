  Spark
  -----
    
    => Spark is in-memory distributed computing framework for big data analytics.	

	in-memory: ability to persist intermediate results and subsequent operations
		   can directly work on these persisted intermediate results. 

     => Spark is written in Scala programming language

     => Spark is polyglot
	-> Support Scala, Java, Python, R

     => Spark can run on multiple cluster managers
	local, spark standalone scheduler, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes

     => Spark is unified analytics framework



  Spark Unified Framework
  -----------------------

	Spark provides a consistent set of APIs for performing different analytics workloads
        using the same execution engine and some well defined data abstractions and operations.

   	Batch Analytics of unstructured data	-> Spark Core API (low-level api)
	Batch Analytics of structured data 	-> Spark SQL
	Streaming Analytics (real time)		-> Spark Streaming, Structured Streaming
	Predictive analytics (ML)		-> Spark MLLib
	Graph parallel computations  		-> Spark GraphX

   Spark Architecture
   ------------------

    	1. Cluster Manager (CM)
		-> Applications are submitted to CMs
		-> Allocates containers for lauching driver and executors on the cluster. 
		-> Spark supports multiple CMs
			-> local, standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes		

	2. Driver
		-> Master process
		-> Runs the 'SparkContext' object
		-> Manages the user code and sends the tasks to the executors as per the code. 

		Deploy Modes:
		-> Where to run the driver process
		1. Client : default, driver runs on the client. 
		2. Cluster: driver runs on one of the nodes on the cluster.

	3. SparkContext
		-> Is an application context
		-> Starting point of execution
		-> Is the link between the driver and tasks running on the executors

	4. Executors
		-> receives the tasks from the Driver
		-> all tasks run the same execution code but on different partitions of the data
		-> the status of tasks are reported to the driver. 
 



   RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)
   -----------------------------------

	-> RDD is the fundamental data abstraction of Spark

	-> RDD is a collection of distributed in-memory partitions.
	    -> Each partition is a collection of objects of some type.

	-> RDDs are immutable

	-> RDDs are lazily evaluated
	   -> Transformations does not cause execution.
	   -> Action commands trigger execution.



   Creating RDDs
   -------------

	Three ways:

	1. Creating an RDD from external data file

		rdd1 = sc.textFile(<dataPath>, 4)

		default Number of partitions: sc.defaultMinPartition
		  sc.defaultMinPartition = 2, if number of cores >= 2
					   1, otherwise


	2. Creating an RDD from programmatic data

		rdd1 = sc.parallelize([2,1,3,2,4,3,5,4,6,7,5,6,7,6,8,8,9,0], 2)

		default Number of partitions: sc.defaultParallelism
		sc.defaultParallelism = number of CPU cores allocated.


	3. By applying transformations on existing RDDs

		rdd2 = rdd1.map(lambda x: x*10)


   RDD Operations
   --------------

    Two types of operations

	1. Transformations
		-> Transformations return RDDs
		-> Transformations does not cause execution of RDDs
		-> Cause lineage DAGs to be created

	2. Actions
		-> Triggers execution of RDDs
		-> Produces output by sending a Job to the cluster


   RDD Lineage DAG
   ---------------  
    Driver maintains a Lineage DAG for every RDD.
    Lineage DAG is a heirarchy of dependencies of RDDs all the way starting from the very first RDD.	
    Lineage DAG is a logical plan on how to create the RDD.

	rddFile = sc.textFile("E:\\Spark\\wordcount.txt", 4)
	Linage DAG of rddFile: (4) rddFile -> sc.textFile on "E:\\Spark\\wordcount.txt"

	rddWords = rddFile.flatMap(lambda x: x.split())
	Linage DAG of rddWords: (4) rddWords -> rddFile -> sc.textFile on "E:\\Spark\\wordcount.txt"

	rddPairs = rddWords.map(lambda x: (x, 1))
	Linage DAG of rddPairs: (4) rddPairs -> rddWords -> rddFile -> sc.textFile

	rddWc = rddPairs.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y)
	Linage DAG of rddWc: (4) rddWc -> rddPairs -> rddWords -> rddFile -> sc.textFile
