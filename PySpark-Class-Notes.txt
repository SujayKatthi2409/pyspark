  Spark
  -----

    => Spark is in-memory distributed computing framework for big data analytics.

	in-memory: ability to persist intermediate results in RAM and subsequent operations
		   can directly work on these persisted intermediate results. 

    => Spark is written in Scala programming language

    => Spark is a polyglot
	-> Scala, Java, Python, R (and SQL)

    => Spark applications can run on:
	-> local, Spark standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes

    => Spark is unified analytics framework.
	

  Spark Unified Framework
  -----------------------

    Spark provides a consistent set of APIs for performing different analytics workloads
    using the same execution engine and some well defined data abstractions and operations.

	Batch Analytics			-> Spark SQL
	Streaming Analytics (real time)	-> Structured Streaming, DStreams API
	Predictive analytics (ML)	-> Spark MLLib  (mllib & ml)
	Graph parallel computations  	-> Spark GraphX
