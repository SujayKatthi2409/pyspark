  Spark
  -----

    => Spark is in-memory distributed computing framework for big data analytics.

	in-memory: ability to persist intermediate results in RAM and subsequent operations
		   can directly work on these persisted intermediate results. 

    => Spark is written in Scala programming language

    => Spark is a polyglot
	-> Scala, Java, Python, R (and SQL)

    => Spark applications can run on:
	-> local, Spark standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes

    => Spark is unified analytics framework.
	

  Spark Unified Framework
  -----------------------

    Spark provides a consistent set of APIs for performing different analytics workloads
    using the same execution engine and some well defined data abstractions and operations.

	Batch Analytics			-> Spark SQL
	Streaming Analytics (real time)	-> Structured Streaming, DStreams API
	Predictive analytics (ML)	-> Spark MLLib  (mllib & ml)
	Graph parallel computations  	-> Spark GraphX

 	Enabling DBFS File browser
	--------------------------
	<your account (top-right)> -> Settings -> Advanced -> Other -> DBFS File Browser (enable it)		


  Databricks Basics
  -----------------
	
	1. Compute - Spin up cluster resources		
		1. All purpose clusters - continuously running, persistent cluster
		2. Job clusters - spinned up to execute a job and then terminated	

	2. Catalog
		-> All data is stored in Catalog
		-> All local files are store in /FileStore directory
		-> Default hive warehouse directory : /user/hive/warehouse

	3. Workspace
		-> All the notebooks are managed in the workspace


  Spark Architecture
  ------------------

	1. Cluster Manager (CM)
		-> Applications are submitted to CMs
		-> Allocates containers for lauching driver and executors on the cluster. 
		-> Spark supports multiple CMs
			-> local, standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes		

	2. Driver
		-> Master process
		-> Runs the 'SparkContext' object
		-> Manages the user code and sends the tasks to the executors as per the code. 

		Deploy Modes:
		  -> Where to run the driver process
		  1. Client : default, driver runs on the client. 
		  2. Cluster: driver runs on one of the nodes on the cluster.

	3. SparkContext
		-> Is an application context
		-> Starting point of execution
		-> Is the link between the driver and tasks running on the executors

	4. Executors
		-> Receives the tasks from the Driver
		-> All tasks run the same code but on different partitions of the data
		-> The status of tasks are reported to the driver. 


    RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)
  -----------------------------------

	-> RDD is the fundamental data abstraction of Spark

	-> RDD is a collection of distributed in-memory partitions.
	    -> Each partition is a collection of objects of some type.

	-> RDDs are immutable

	-> RDDs are lazily evaluated
	   -> Transformations does not cause execution.
	   -> Action commands trigger execution. 


   Creating RDDs
   -------------
    Three ways:

	1. Creating an RDD from external data file

		rdd1 = sc.textFile(<dataPath>, 4)

		default Number of partitions: sc.defaultMinPartition
		  sc.defaultMinPartition = 2, if number of cores >= 2
					   1, otherwise

	2. Creating an RDD from programmatic data

		rdd1 = sc.parallelize([2,1,3,2,4,3,5,4,6,7,5,6,7,6,8,8,9,0], 2)

		default Number of partitions: sc.defaultParallelism
		sc.defaultParallelism = number of CPU cores allocated.

	3. By applying transformations on existing RDDs

		rdd2 = rdd1.map(lambda x: x*10)


   RDD Operations
   --------------

    Two types of operations

	1. Transformations
		-> Transformations return RDDs
		-> Transformations does not cause execution of RDDs
		-> Cause lineage DAGs to be created

	2. Actions
		-> Triggers execution of RDDs
		-> Produces output by sending a Job to the cluster


  RDD Lineage DAG
  ---------------
    Driver maintains a Lineage DAG for every RDD.
    Lineage DAG is a heirarchy of dependencies of RDDs all the way starting from the very first RDD.	
    Lineage DAG is a logical plan on how to create the RDD partitions.

	rddFile = sc.textFile("E:\\Spark\\wordcount.txt", 4)
	Lineage DAG: (4) rddFile -> sc.textFile on E:\\Spark\\wordcount.txt

	rddWords = rddFile.flatMap(lambda x: x.split())
	Lineage DAG: (4) rddWords -> rddFile.flatMap -> sc.textFile

	rddPairs = rddWords.map(lambda x: (x, 1))
	Lineage DAG: (4) rddPairs -> rddWords.map -> rddFile.flatMap -> sc.textFile

	rddWc = rddPairs.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y)
	Lineage DAG: (4) rddWc -> rddPairs.reduceByKey -> rddWords.map -> rddFile.flatMap -> sc.textFile
